# is-my-bus-changing

Metro is redesigning its bus service as part of the [NextGen project](https://www.metro.net/projects/nextgen/).  Service updates will be rolled out as part of the regular bi-annual service shakeups that occur every December and June.

The initial set of changes will go into effect on Sunday, December 13, 2020.

This tool will be under continuous development to better communicate service changes to our ridership.  Our goal is to implement features iteratively based on user feedback.

the Metro team : )
